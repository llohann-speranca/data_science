    "- `inflight_meal`: is there a meal included in the flight?\n",
    "- `inflight_entertainment`: are there free entertainment systems for each seat?\n",
    "- `inflight_wifi`: is there complimentary wifi on the flight?\n",
    "- `day_of_week`: day of the week of the flight\n",
    "- `weekend`: did this flight take place on a weekend?\n",
    "- `coach_price`: the average price paid for a coach ticket\n",
    "- `firstclass_price`: the average price paid for first-class seats\n",
    "- `hours`: how many hours the flight took\n",
